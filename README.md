EnemyCount
======

## Notice
This method of counting enemies doesn't work consistently.  It will frequently have duplicated enemies and as far as I can tell, it's impossible to know which ones are duplicates.  I may come back to this and make it read the evtc logs - these logs were my source of truth for counting enemies.

## About
This is a Guild Wars 2 BlishHUD module which displays a window in game with the counts and class breakdowns of enemy teams after WvW fights.
